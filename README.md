#Sign Language Detection using Machine Learning
This project implements real-time sign language detection using machine learning and computer vision. It leverages MediaPipe for hand tracking and a trained ML model to recognize different sign language gestures.

Features
âœ… Real-time sign recognition using a webcam
âœ… Deep learning model for gesture classification
âœ… Hand tracking with MediaPipe
âœ… Bounding box visualization for detected signs
âœ… User-friendly interface for live detection

Tech Stack
Python (OpenCV, NumPy, MediaPipe)
Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
Computer Vision for gesture extraction
Flask/Streamlit (for deployment)
Usage
Clone the repository
Install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
Run python sign_detection.py
Start signing and see real-time predictions!
